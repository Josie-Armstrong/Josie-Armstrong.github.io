    <h1>Hi! I'm Josie (they/them)</h1>
    <h2>CTD and Film Production major, Sophomore</h2>
    <p>I'm a Colorado native (lived in Fort Collins all my life), a cat person, and a <em>huge</em> nerd.<br/>I'm taking this course because it's required (sorry). So my goal is to get the credit and a good grade.<br/>But I also want to have fun! And learn stuff. Learning stuff is cool.</p>
