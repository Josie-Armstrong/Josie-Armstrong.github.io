        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Anonymouse Whiskers, a private eye who roams the streets solving crime in Mousetropolis.
            <br>You may know me from my work on the Case of the Missing Cheese, or from my bestselling book
            <em>Woe is Whiskers: The Tail of a Sleuth</em> (2023).
            <br>While I live in Mousetropolis, I'm originally from Mouseville, a small town out west.
            I moved to Mousetropolis at 34 and never looked back!</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>As a mouse detective, my greatest goal is to solve the Great Mousetropolis Heist of 1982.
            <br>While I was just a young mouse then, I've thought about it every day since. It's the greatest mystery of our time.
            <br>As a bestselling author of <em>Woe is Whiskers: The Tail of a Sleuth</em>, I want to continue writing the adventures of Arnold Whiskers.
            <br>Arnold, of course, has no relation to me (Anonymouse Whiskers), but his stories are inspired by my own sleuthing experiences.</p>
