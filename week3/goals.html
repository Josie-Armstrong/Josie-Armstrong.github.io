            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>As a mouse detective, my greatest goal is to solve the Great Mousetropolis Heist of 1982.
                <br>While I was just a young mouse then, I've thought about it every day since. It's the greatest mystery of our time.
                <br>As a bestselling author of <em>Woe is Whiskers: The Tail of a Sleuth</em>, I want to continue writing the adventures of Arnold Whiskers.
                <br>Arnold, of course, has no relation to me (Anonymouse Whiskers), but his stories are inspired by my own sleuthing experiences.</p>
